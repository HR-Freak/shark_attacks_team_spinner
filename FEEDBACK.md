# Feedback

## Good stuff

- Anna, really loved the checks on each data preprocessing step + the commenting of what you did
- Your code is easily readable, you have good names for variables, the notebook was overall well-organized, I'm very happy about your process! 

## To improve

- Remember to create the intermediate data!
- A few more comments on what you gather from the data during exploration, e.g. where is most of the data located, where do you have nulls
- To add: null handling for the rest of the variables, checking for duplicates
- Rename Jupyter notebook - it should be `data-cleaning`, not `shark-attack`, as you want separate notebooks for separate steps of the analysis process.

## For next time:
- Try to go for a more suggestive title for the GitHub repository which is connected to your business idea, e.g. Risk Analysis for Travel Health Insurance   
- Use a template for the README file as soon as you create the repository. I know we discussed about it and I didn't stress it, hence why it's for next time! This way you will be able to edit it / iterate on it as you work on the project. Use Christine Jiang's first video feedback [as a reference](https://youtu.be/UddfFCI70iw?t=1885) for what works.
